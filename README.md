# BitcoinMiner

Mine Bitcoin (pBTC) with EOS CPU / NET Resources and an EOS wallet compatible with ScatterJS.  https://meet.one/ and https://www.tokenpocket.pro/ work fine and https://get-scatter.com/ may too, but newer versions have been found to be buggy.

This is a good tool to have after you've created a wallet.  You can rent eos direct to your cpu if you want to mine with more than you own. Renting and mining has risk, mining with EOS you own doesn't.
